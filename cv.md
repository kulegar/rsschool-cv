### About me

I’m Yegor. I started learning Front-end in 2015, but after some time stopped doing it. When I entered the university in 2017, I continued studying Front-end, but after some time stopped doing it again. Now it is my third attempt, and I am determined to become a junior Front-end developer. I believe that rsschool will help me. I can’t say that I’m a very fast learner, because if I need to learn something I learn it really well. I don’t like when I don’t understand something.
